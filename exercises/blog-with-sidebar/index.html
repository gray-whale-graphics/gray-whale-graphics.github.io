                        DreamWorks’ 2010 animated feature How to Train Your 
                        Dragon produced glowing reviews and Oscar nominations 
                        for Best Animated Feature Film for directors Dean 
                        DeBlois and Chris Sanders. This year, DeBlois, the voice 
                        cast, and many of the people on the 2010 crew bring us 
                        the eagerly awaited How to Train Your Dragon 2, which is 
                        already receiving rave reviews from top critics. It’s 
                        five years later in the story, as well. The young Viking 
                        Hiccup is now 20 years old and he and his dragon 
                        Toothless are now partners, friends, accomplished 
                        flyers, and intrepid explorers, which leads them to 
                        discover Hiccup’s mother, and encounter unexpected 
                        danger. How to Train Your Dragon 2 premiered at the 
                        Cannes Film Festival May 16 and is scheduled for US 
                        release June 13.

                        Dane Stogner, a former Animation Mentor student who 
                        joined DreamWorks Animation to work on Madagascar: 
                        Escape 2 Africa, became an expert on Toothless during 
                        the first Dragon film. For Dragon 2, he took charge of 
                        the hero dragon as Character Lead Animator for 
                        Toothless. We talked with Stogner about his experiences 
                        animating the friendly yet dangerous Night Fury.

                        “Dragon 2 is the first show to use Premo, DreamWorks’ 
                        new animation software system,” Stogner says. “So I had 
                        to conceptualize how we could work with Toothless in the 
                        new system. I spent the first nine months on the show 
                        dividing my time evenly between Premo development, 
                        Toothless rig and library development, and animation. 
                        I worked with the face and body riggers to develop his 
                        face and body rig for the new software. Every way we 
                        interacted with the character was new.”

                    <h3 class="title"> 
                        New software can completely change the way animators 
                        work.

                        “We went from using, arguably, one of the most archaic 
                        animation software in existence to what I would say is 
                        the best in the business,” Stogner says. “It’s a giant 
                        leap forward. Premo, the new software, is always live. 
                        You can press play and it will play back in realtime 
                        with full resolution geometry and a bit of surfacing at 
                        any second. There’s no such thing as a playblast. We can 
                        adjust curves and poses on the fly, even while it’s 
                        playing. It’s unbelievable. I think the developers 
                        started from the vantage point of what animators have 
                        always wanted and they made it.

                    <p>
                        “Premo was designed around the idea that animators would 
                        have a [Wacom] Cintiq. So, we can just touch and move 
                        the character. It is almost like stop motion sometimes. 
                        Even on the face. Just push and pull parts of the face 
                        around on the surface. We have fully integrated pose 
                        libraries, control hierarchies, ghosting, paths, follow 
                        cams, and built-in drawing tools with layers like 
                        Photoshop. The drawing tools were so easy to use I 
                        sometimes did 2D pencil tests in the shot on top of the 
                        background rather than shooting reference. It’s 
                        exciting.”

                        “For the first film, we mostly referenced black 
                        panthers, house cats and wombats for Toothless’ body 
                        language,” Stogner says. “He was very cat-like and 
                        stand-offish and mysterious, a scary creature that 
                        Hiccup had to befriend. So cats were appropriate. But, 
                        two out of three of us Toothless experts, and even Dean 
                        DeBlois himself, are greater fans of dogs than cats, 
                        and I think there’s legitimacy in the story for having 
                        his personality come across more puppy or dog-like in 
                        this film. He’s been living with Hiccup for five years. 
                        In addition, my favorite pet was my rabbit Waxwick, so 
                        I used any opportunity I could to throw in a little 
                        rabbit flavor. I’ll definitely try to add more in the 
                        next film. There’s a little behavior rabbits do that 
                        rabbit fans call binkying where they hop in circles. 
                        It’s really cute. They look a little like they’re 
                        having a seizure, but they are just happy.
