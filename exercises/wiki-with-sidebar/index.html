                            The Russian Blue cat (Russian: Русская голубая 
                            кошка, romanized: Russkaya golubaya koshka), 
                            commonly referred to as just Russian Blue, is a cat 
                            breed with colors that vary from a light shimmering 
                            silver to a darker, slate grey. The short, dense 
                            coat, which stands out from the body, has been the 
                            breed's hallmark for more than a century.

                        <p>
                            The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that 
                            may have originated in the port of Arkhangelsk in 
                            Russia.[1] They are also sometimes called Archangel 
                            Blues.[2] It is believed that sailors took them from 
                            the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern 
                            Europe in the 1860s.[1] The first reference to an 
                            Archangel Cat appears in British print in 1862.[3] 
                            The first recorded appearance of one in a show was 
                            in 1872 at The Crystal Palace in England as the 
                            Archangel Cat. [4] However, Harrison Weir writing 
                            in 1895 reported that the early show cats under the 
                            Russian Blue name were British-bred grey tabbies, 
                            with separate grey cats arriving from Archangel in 
                            Britain in the 1800s with features consistent with 
                            the modern breed. [5] The Russian Blue competed in a 
                            class including all other blue cats until 1912, when 
                            it was given its own class. The breed was developed 
                            mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World 
                            War II.

                            Right after the war, a lack of numbers of Russian 
                            Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese. 
                            Although Russian Blues were in the United States 
                            before the war, it was not until the post-war period 
                            that American breeders created the modern Russian 
                            Blue that is seen in the United States today. 
                            American breeders combined the bloodlines of both 
                            the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues. The 
                            Siamese traits have now largely been bred out. The 
                            short hair and slate-gray/blue color is often seen 
                            in mixed-breed cats, which can affect breeders and 
                            showers due to mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue.

                            Russian Blues are plush short-haired, shimmering 
                            pale blue-gray cats with emerald green eyes or 
                            yellow eyes. Guard hairs are distinctly 
                            silver-tipped giving the cat a silvery sheen or 
                            lustrous appearance. They have been used on a 
                            limited basis to create other breeds such as the 
                            Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the 
                            Nebelung. They are being used in Italy as a way to 
                            make Oriental Shorthairs healthier and more robust 
                            called RUS4OSH in FIFe.[7]

                    The Russian Blue has bright green eyes, pinkish lavender or 
                    mauve paws, two layers of short thick fur, and a 
                    blue-grey-black coat.[9] The color is a bluish-gray that is 
                    the dilute expression of the black gene. However, as dilute 
                    genes are recessive ("d") and each parent will have a set of 
                    two recessive genes ("dd") two non-Color-Point Carrier 
                    (non-CPC) Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat.

                <h3 id="coat"> Coat </h3>
                <p>
                    The coat is known as a "double coat", with the undercoat 
                    being soft, downy and equal in length to the guard hairs, 
                    which are an even blue with silver tips. However, the tail 
                    may have a few very dull, almost unnoticeable stripes. The 
                    coat is described as thick, plush and soft to the touch and 
                    can be described as being softer than the softest silk. The 
                    silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance. Its eyes 
                    are almost always a dark and vivid green. Any white patches 
                    of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show 
                    cats.[6] Russian Blues should not be confused with British 
                    Blues (which are not a distinct breed, but rather a British 
                    Shorthair with a blue coat as the British Shorthair breed 
                    itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns), nor 
                    the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally 
                    occurring breeds of blue cats, although they have similar 
                    traits.

                <p>
                    They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there 
                    are always exceptions. They are normally reserved around 
                    strangers, unless they are brought up in an active 
                    household. Many Russian Blues have been trained to do 
                    tricks. They can also be fierce hunters, often catching 
                    rodents, birds, rabbits, small mammals, or reptiles. As 
                    loving and easy going as Russian Blues are, they do not 
                    like change, and prefer predictable, routine schedules.

                    They are small to moderate-sized cats with an average weight 
                    of 3.6 to 6.8 kg (8 to 15 lb) when fully grown.[11] Males 
                    will typically be larger than females. Their gestation 
                    period is approximately 64 days.

                <p>
                    Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Russian Blue may be 
                    better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate 
                    allergies. There is speculation that the Russian Blue 
                    produces less glycoprotein Fel d 1, one source of cat 
                    allergies. The thicker coat may also trap more of the 
                    allergens closer to the cat's skin. Glycoprotein is one 
                    source of cat allergies, but this does not mean that all 
                    allergies will be stopped. They can still happen, but not 
                    as extreme, and for a much less amount of time than other 
                    cat breeds. Because of this, Russian Blues are very popular
                    with people with allergies all around the world.
